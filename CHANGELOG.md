## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed

**Linter & Parser — CloudFormation intrinsic Resource references**

Task states using CloudFormation intrinsic functions for their `Resource` field (e.g. `Fn::GetAtt: [MyLambda, Arn]` or `!GetAtt MyLambda.Arn`) no longer crash the linter or parser:

- **`Fn::GetAtt` / `Fn::Sub` (map form)** — parsed as an object by the YAML library; `??` did not fall back to `""`, causing `.includes()` and `.startsWith()` calls to throw at runtime
- **`!GetAtt` / `!Ref` (tag form)** — parsed as a plain string without colons (e.g. `"MyLambda.Arn"`); now correctly identified as an unresolvable CF reference and excluded from ARN validation
- All ARN-based checks (format, SDK pattern compatibility, HTTP Task field requirements) are skipped for these references — they are only applicable to literal ARN strings and have no false-positive risk here

**Linter — dynamic value false positives removed**

Fields that accept dynamic values (JSONata expressions `{%…%}` or JSONPath references `$.` / `$$.`) no longer trigger static-format validators:

- **`Timestamp` in Wait state** — RFC3339 validation skipped when value is a JSONata expression or JSONPath reference
- **`TimestampEquals` / `TimestampGreaterThan` / … in Choice branches** — same
- **HTTP Task `Method`** — accepted method validation skipped for dynamic values
- **`Retry.JitterStrategy`** — `FULL`/`NONE` enum check skipped for dynamic values
- **R-12 (`HeartbeatSeconds < TimeoutSeconds`)** — comparison skipped when either field is not a plain number, preventing a lexicographic false positive when both are dynamic expressions

**Linter — false positive warnings removed**

All checks that assumed a specific workflow type (Standard vs Express) have been removed. The linter cannot determine the workflow type from the ASL definition alone, so these rules generated spurious warnings on every valid Standard workflow.

- **DISTRIBUTED Map** — warning "requires a Standard workflow" removed; DISTRIBUTED mode is valid in both Standard and Express parent workflows
- **Activity ARN** — warning "not supported in Express workflows" removed; Activities are valid in Standard workflows
- **`.sync` / `.sync:2` integration pattern** — warning "requires a Standard workflow" removed; these patterns are documented constraints, not detectable errors without knowing the parent type
- **`.waitForTaskToken` integration pattern** — same removal rationale
- **`End: true` on Succeed/Fail** — warning "implicit and redundant" removed; AWS silently ignores the field and many users write it explicitly for clarity
- **HTTP Task without `ConnectionArn`** — recommendation warning removed; public APIs do not require authentication
- **`MaxConcurrency: 0`** — warning "unlimited concurrency" removed; 0 is the documented and intentional way to express unlimited concurrency
- **`Iterator` deprecated** — migration warning removed; `Iterator` still works and the warning generated permanent noise on legacy codebases
- **`Parameters` deprecated in Map** — same removal rationale

**Linter — precision fix**

- **`waitForTaskToken` without `HeartbeatSeconds`** — now only warns when neither `HeartbeatSeconds` nor `TimeoutSeconds` (nor their `*Path` variants) is set; a state-level `TimeoutSeconds` prevents indefinite blocking and was previously ignored by this check

**Graph preview — black screen (additional fixes)**

- **Initial fit** — all Cytoscape instances now call `resize()` + `fit()` inside a `requestAnimationFrame` after init, guaranteeing the browser has completed its flex layout before Cytoscape measures container dimensions
- **`update` viewport** — the `update` message handler no longer restores the previous zoom/pan after a layout rerun; it now calls `fit()` on the active tab, preventing the view from landing on an empty area when node positions shift
- **`resize` handler scope** — the `resize` message now iterates all instances (not only the active tab), ensuring hidden sub-graph tabs are also corrected when the panel becomes visible

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed

**Graph preview — black screen**

- **Vendor bundle** — Cytoscape and dagre are now bundled locally (`webview/vendor.js` via esbuild); CDN scripts could be blocked by corporate proxies or offline environments, causing a silent blank canvas
- **CSP** — Content-Security-Policy now uses `${webview.cspSource}` exclusively; the previous mixed `cdn.jsdelivr.net` source was rejected by strict VS Code webview sandboxing
- **Error surface** — `window.onerror` and a top-level `try/catch` now catch any rendering failure and display a readable message in the graph area instead of leaving the panel blank
- **`retainContextWhenHidden`** — webview context was destroyed each time the panel was hidden (tab switch, split editor); state, zoom, and pan were lost and the canvas could not recover without a full reload
- **`onDidChangeViewState` resize** — when the panel was revealed after being hidden, the Cytoscape container had 0×0 dimensions; a `resize` + `fit` is now triggered on visibility change

**Linter**

- **R-3 / R-6 duplicate errors** — both rules fired on `Parallel` and `Map` states that have neither `Next` nor `End` (which is valid — they terminate via branches); R-3 now excludes `Parallel` and `Map` state types

**Graph correctness**

- **Ghost nodes for missing state references** — edges pointing to an undeclared state name (broken `Next`, `Default`, `Catch`, `Choices`) previously caused Cytoscape to crash; the missing state is now rendered as a dashed red `(not found)` ghost node so the graph remains usable and the broken reference is visible
- **Ghost node click guard** — clicking a ghost node no longer sends a `goto` message to the extension (the state does not exist in the source)
- **Recursive `extractSubGraphs`** — nested `Parallel`/`Map` states (a branch containing another `Parallel`, etc.) now produce tabs at every depth level; previously only the first level was extracted

### Improved

- **Smart reload notification** — on extension update, patch bumps (`0.1.x → 0.1.y`) trigger the less intrusive `restartExtensionHost`; minor and major bumps (`0.x → 0.y` or `x → y`) trigger a full `reloadWindow` to ensure webview assets are refreshed

### Infrastructure

- **ESLint v9 flat config** — migrated from `.eslintrc.json` to `eslint.config.js` (`eslint.config.js` format required by ESLint ≥ 9)

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-19

### Added

**New linter rules**

- **Task without `Resource`** — Task states must have a `Resource`; missing field now reported as an error
- **Choice with `End` or `Next`** — these fields are forbidden at the Choice state level (transitions are expressed via `Choices[].Next` and `Default`)
- **`Version` validation** — only `"1.0"` is accepted when the field is present
- **`QueryLanguage` validation** — both definition-level and state-level `QueryLanguage` must be `"JSONata"` or `"JSONPath"`
- **Global `TimeoutSeconds`** — definition-level `TimeoutSeconds` validated in range 1–99999999
- **`Retry.IntervalSeconds` upper bound** — max 99999999 (lower bound ≥ 1 already existed)
- **`Retry.MaxDelaySeconds`** — validated in range 1–31622400
- **`Retry.MaxAttempts`** — must be ≥ 0
- **`Retry.JitterStrategy`** — must be `"FULL"` or `"NONE"`
- **`TimeoutSeconds` / `HeartbeatSeconds` upper bounds** — max 99999999 at state level
- **`Label` on INLINE Map** — warning when `Label` is set on a Map with `Mode: INLINE` (DISTRIBUTED-only field)
- **`ItemBatcher`, `ItemReader`, `ResultWriter` on INLINE Map** — warning for each DISTRIBUTED-only field used in `Mode: INLINE`
- **JSONata mode — Fail state path fields** — `ErrorPath` and `CausePath` are JSONPath-only; errors emitted in JSONata mode
- **JSONata mode — Map path fields** — `MaxConcurrencyPath`, `ToleratedFailureCountPath`, `ToleratedFailurePercentagePath` are JSONPath-only; errors emitted in JSONata mode
- **`Assign` in JSONPath mode** — `Assign` is a JSONata-only field; warning emitted in JSONPath mode
- **J-2 recursive** — `Variable` / `Condition` check now traverses `Not`, `And`, and `Or` boolean operators recursively
- **Timestamp RFC3339 recursive** — `TimestampEquals` and friends validated recursively through `Not`/`And`/`Or` branches

**Infrastructure**

- `onDidChangeConfiguration` handler — setting changes apply immediately: disabling `autoDetect` clears all diagnostics; toggling `lintOnType`/`lintOnSave` re-lints open files at once
- `@vscode/vsce` added to `devDependencies` (pinned version, no more floating `npx vsce`)
- CI Node matrix extended to `[18, 20, 22, 24]`
- CI lint job now includes a `tsc` type-check step

### Changed

- **R-23** severity upgraded from Warning → **Error**: `Mode: INLINE` with `MaxConcurrency > 40` is a hard AWS limit
- `lintOnType` description updated to mention the 200 ms debounce

### Fixed

- **`toGraphData` dangling edge** — `__START__ → StartAt` edge was created even when `StartAt` was not present in `States`, which could crash Cytoscape; now guarded
- **`Fail` / `Succeed` not connected to `__END__`** — only states with explicit `End: true` were wired to the End node; `Fail` and `Succeed` are terminal by definition and now always produce a `→ __END__` edge
- **`__END__` absent when only `Fail` / `Succeed` terminate the machine** — the End node was created only when `some(s => s.End)`; it is now created whenever any state is terminal (`End: true`, `Type: Fail`, or `Type: Succeed`)
- **`Fail` node label** — `Error` (or `Cause` if `Error` is absent) is now shown as a second line in the node label, giving instant context without navigating to the source
- **`preview.ts` goto handler** — replaced naive `String.includes()` match (could match `"A:"` inside `"arn:aws:lambda:::fn"`) with the same `^\s+(name|"name")\s*:` regex used by the linter
- **Webview JSON injection** — `JSON.stringify` does not escape `<`/`>`; added `safeJson` helper that replaces them with `\u003c`/`\u003e` to prevent `</script>` injection from state names
- **`deactivate()`** — debounce timer is now cleared on extension deactivation (no orphan callback)
- **Keystroke debounce** — lint and preview update are debounced at 200 ms; `updateSfnContext` (icon visibility) remains immediate
- **`reachableStates`** — removed a dead loop that pushed Parallel branch state names into the DFS stack; those names never resolved against `def.States` (branch states live in their own scope)

### Tests

- **212 unit tests** (up from 162) — full coverage for all new rules and bug fixes

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- Initial release
- Interactive Cytoscape.js graph preview with dagre layout
- Color-coded nodes by state type
- Click-to-navigate (node → editor line)
- Serverless Framework YAML support
- **Raw JSON ASL** format support (previously only YAML)
- Serverless Framework flat wrapper format: `{ definition: { StartAt, States } }`
- **Cursor-to-graph highlight** — moving the cursor in the editor highlights the corresponding node in the graph preview
- `steplens.isSfnFile` context key controls toolbar icon visibility
- **Real-time linter** with rules R-1 through R-8 and W-1
- Inline diagnostics (squiggly underlines) via `vscode.DiagnosticCollection`
- `steplens.lintOnType`, `steplens.lintOnSave`, `steplens.autoDetect` settings
- **JSONata Choice condition** support — `Condition: "{% … %}"` used as edge label instead of `Variable` path
- Choice node color: yellow diamond (was a plain rectangle)
- Catch edge labels show full `ErrorEquals` array
- **Hover tooltips** on linter underlines — shows error/warning message with `$(error)` / `$(warning)` icons
- **Status bar item** — displays `✓ StepLens`, `⚠ N warnings`, or `✗ N errors`; click to open the Problems panel
- **Sub-graph tabs** for Parallel branches and Map iterators — each branch opens in its own tab beside "Main"
- All Cytoscape instances initialised upfront with `visibility:hidden` (keeps real container dimensions, fixing the 0×0 sizing issue that caused empty sub-graph views)
- **Export** to PNG and JPEG via ⬇ PNG / ⬇ JPEG buttons in the graph toolbar
- **Map `ItemProcessor`** support — newer ASL format (SDK v2 / AWS Console export) used `ItemProcessor` instead of `Iterator`; sub-graph tabs now appear for both
- **Double-click** to navigate into Parallel / Map sub-graph tabs (was single-click)
- Hint text updated: "Double-click Parallel/Map to explore sub-graph"
- **R-9** — Map `Iterator` / `ItemProcessor` validation (recursive lint, like R-7 for Parallel)
- **R-10** — `MaxConcurrency: 0` warning on Map states (unlimited concurrency)
- **← Main** back button — appears automatically when viewing a sub-graph tab
- **⊡ Fit** button in toolbar — recenters the graph
- **State count** badge on each tab (`Main (8)`, `ProcessBatch — Iterator (4)`)
- **↺** suffix in node label for states that have `Retry` configured
- **×N** suffix in Map node labels for `MaxConcurrency` (`×∞` when 0)
- `Assign`, `MaxConcurrency`, `InputPath`, `OutputPath`, `QueryLanguage` added to `AslState` interface
- **J-1** — Detects wrong fields per query language: `Parameters`↔`Arguments`, `OutputPath`↔`Output`, `InputPath`, `ResultPath` in JSONata mode
- **J-2** — Choice branches: `Variable` vs `Condition` per mode; warns when `Condition` is missing `{%…%}` delimiters
- **J-3** — Validates every `{%…%}` expression: empty, unclosed delimiters, `$eval()`, JSONPath `$.` inside JSONata, trailing operator
- **J-4** — `$states.result` scope check: error when used in Pass, Choice, Wait, Succeed, or Fail states
- `QueryLanguage` per-state override supported (`AslState.QueryLanguage`)
- Parallel branches and Map iterators inherit parent `QueryLanguage` for recursive linting
- **Syntax highlighting** for `{% … %}` JSONata expressions inside YAML and JSON files (TextMate grammar injection — colors adapt to your theme)
- **Keybinding** `Ctrl+Alt+G` / `Cmd+Alt+G` to open the graph preview
- **CHANGELOG.md**

### Fixed
- Parser now handles the Serverless Framework *named wrapper* format (`machineName: { definition: { States } }`), which was silently ignored before — example files now parse and lint correctly
- JSON state name detection: line-finder regex now matches both `StateName:` (YAML) and `"StateName":` (JSON)
- Choice branch edge labels no longer show `b1`, `b2` when `Variable` path is available
- `Catch` edge labels now show the full error name (`States.ALL`, `States.TaskFailed`) — the `States.` prefix was incorrectly stripped
- Cursor highlight now works for states inside Parallel branches and Map iterators — `stateAtLine()` previously only searched top-level states
- Highlight color reverted to orange (`#f5a623`) — it had been changed to cyan to avoid a conflict with Choice yellow, but the user preferred orange
- Preview no longer dezoom on every keystroke — structural change detection sends a lightweight `update` message that preserves zoom/pan instead of rebuilding the full HTML
- Choice node color changed to yellow (`#ffe033`) — was the same orange as the cursor highlight, causing confusion
- Single-click on Parallel/Map nodes previously switched to the sub-graph tab — now requires **double-click** (single-click still jumps to the line in the editor)
- Node `goto` and `nodeToTab` lookup now use the node `id` (= state name), not the display label, so `↺`/`×N` suffixes don't break navigation

### Improved
- Description updated to reflect 14 linter rules
- Added `jsonata` and `workflow` keywords for Marketplace discoverability
